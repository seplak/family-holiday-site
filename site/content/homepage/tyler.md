2020 was quite the year. At the beginning of March right when Boston went into quarantine, Alie and I decided to make a trip to CT to stay with her parents. What we thought was going to be a two week stay turned into four months. During this time I graduated from Northeastern University (finally!) and started a full-time job as a DevOps Engineer at SimpliSafe.

Like my father, I have not had my hair cut since the begining of the year and have been negligent about cutting the hair on my face as well. You can all be thankful you don't have to [see me](images/tyler_ugly_mirror_selfie.jpg) this year. Eventually, Alie and I left Connecticut and moved back to Massachusetts into a new apartment a little further away from the city. We have spent the remainder of the year trying to find ways to entertain ourselves in our new space. So far there's been plenty of video games, board games, reading, dog walks, hikes, knitting, and an attempt at learning bass guitar.
