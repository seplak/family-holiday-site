What a challenging year. For you, for me, for everyone. Anyone who suggests otherwise has probably been on a remote, inaccessible island without any lifeline to the outside world. So, rather than focus on the things that we’re all managing, I’d rather focus on the things for which I’m thankful.

I’m thankful for the reasonably good health of my family and friends, and I’m thankful for those who put themselves in harm’s way to fight for the equity, health, and safety of others. I’m thankful for having a job which allows me to work from home and the corresponding commute. I’m thankful not only for video conferences, but also for video conference filters which mask the fact that I haven’t had a haircut since February. I’m thankful for the savings from the lack of haircuts which I’ve been able to put towards quality moustache waxes and beard balms. I’m thankful that I’ve had the ability (and motivation) to spend more time outdoors, something I plan on continuing throughout the winter. And I’m thankful for everyone who has been willing to sacrifice some of their own desires in an effort to protect those around them.

Most of all, I’m thankful that 2020 is coming to an end. Good riddance.
