You probably know me best as the one you know the least. No worries! I embrace that attribute and I can assure you that I do, in fact, exist. A little about me: I graduated from high school last spring and, while it was sad not having an excruciatingly long in-person graduation ceremony, I wore a tiny party hat and fist-pumped when they called my name in the online event. I spent the summer working 40-hour weeks in the electronics section of the germ pool known as Target. I’m very proud of this because, in times of crisis, it is essential for people to come in and touch all of the TVs, cell phones, and tablets they’ll eventually buy off Amazon. In September, I landed at the University of Minnesota – Twin Cities where I’m hoping to major in biomedical engineering. I've managed to make some new friends, but I’m not actually sure who any of them are, what with all the disguises.
