2020 for me followed the same path as many others – as March dragged on, I went from being furloughed to having my job eliminated. Not to worry, though, as I ended up having ample time to decide what was next for me. Following a late September, two-week vision quest in Chicago, I returned home, packed up my belongings and moved to Los Angeles with friends to pursue a change of pace and sharpen my wildfire dodging abilities. Do I like it out here?  I do, but we're in the middle of a lockdown, so the uncertainty of the overall situation is greater than I’d prefer. At least it’s not cold here...
