2020 was supposed to be a big year for me! Well, I guess it still was... I turned 16, I got my driverâ€™s license (on the first try), and I started working at Target where I was asked to be a team captain. Here's how I feel about that:

As you might guess, Iâ€™m trying to avoid becoming drunk on my own power (but itâ€™s sooo hard not to). Iâ€™m also trying to figure out how to excel at distance learning which, you may have heard, isnâ€™t as effective as the in-person type. Zoom calls may be effective replacements for family gatherings (ha!) but there are still some glitches that need to be worked out, most of which are mine ðŸ˜‰.
